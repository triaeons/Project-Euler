# Project Euler: Math and Coding Problems

## Sln files produced with Visual Studio
* [Problem 1](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1) - Multiples of 3 and 5: contains solutions using recursion, tail recursion, and calculating finite series

* [Problem 2](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2) - Even Fibonacci numbers: main.cpp contains iterative solution in addition to solution that solves the problem by adding only                 every third term in the Fibonacci sequence (which are the even numbers if we start with 1, 1, 2, ...). (Memoized) Recursive                 solutions are incomplete, as they calculate the sum of even numbers in the sequence incorrectly and are found in Problem2.h                 and Problem2.cpp.
